    "\n",

    "## Max-Cut Problem and the Petersen Graph\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem Definition\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us begin by formulating the **Max-Cut problem**, a graph $G(V, E)$ separation problem that aims to assign the nodes of a graph into **two disjoint sets**. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Objective**: Maximize the number of edges between nodes assigned to different sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mathematical Formulation\n",
    "\n",
    "The typical formulation of Max-Cut relies on spin variables, since they are easily translated to Ising Hamiltonians and used by QAOA. When we assign a spin variable to each qubit, the product of two connected node variables will tell us whether a cut has occured or not. Formally $s_u s_v = \\pm1$, where $s_u s_v = +1$ means $u$ and $v$ belong to the same group (no cut), or $s_u s_v = -1$, belong to separate groups (cut occurs). As a consequence, minimizing\n",
    "$$ \\underset{s}{\\arg\\min} \\sum_{(u,v) \\in E} s_u s_v$$\n",
    "will find the maximum cut for the input graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since spin variables are not particularily common in classical optimization, we use binary variables $x_v \\in \\{0, 1\\}$ to describe the node assignment of vertex $v$:\n",
    "- $x_v = 0$: vertex $v$ belongs to set A (colored blue in visualizations)\n",
    "- $x_v = 1$: vertex $v$ belongs to set B (colored orange in visualizations)\n",
    "\n",
    "To resemble the Max-Cut objective formulated with spin variables, we want for edge $(u, v)$:\n",
    "- A **positive contribution** (+1) if nodes are in the same set: $x_u = x_v$\n",
    "- A **negative contribution** (-1) if nodes are in disjunct sets: $x_u \\neq x_v$\n",
    "\n",
    "This can be achieved through the construction: $(1 - 2x_u)(1-2x_v) = 4 x_u x_v - 2x_u - 2x_v +1$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Verification**:\n",
    "- When $x_u = x_v = 0$: $-4(0)(0) + 2(0) + 2(0) - 1 = -1$\n",
    "- When $x_u = x_v = 1$: $-4(1)(1) + 2(1) + 2(1) - 1 = -1$  \n",
    "- When $x_u \\neq x_v$: $-4(0)(1) + 2(0) + 2(1) - 1 = +1$ or $-4(1)(0) + 2(1) + 2(0) - 1 = +1$\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, the objective can be phrased as a **minimization** (which is standard for optimization libraries):\n",
    "$$\\underset{x}{\\arg \\min} \\sum_{(u, v) \\in E} (4 x_u x_v - 2x_u - 2x_v + 1)$$\n",

    "### The Petersen Graph\n",
    "\n",
    "We now define the **Petersen graph**, a famous graph in graph theory, for which we want to find the Max-Cut using QAOA. The Petersen graph:\n",
    "- Has 10 vertices and 15 edges\n",
    "- Is highly symmetric\n",
    "- Serves as a counterexample to many graph theory conjectures\n",
    "- Has a known maximum cut value of 9"
